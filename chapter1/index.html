    <p>For a few years now, decided to cut out soda and sugar drinks but like the sweet taste.
        <br>Something that worked for me was the Zevia sodas.
        It is flavored water but tastes just like soda to me.<br/>
        The flavors I would recommend the most would be grape, root beer and strawberry.</p>
